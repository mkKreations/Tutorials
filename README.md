## Description

Tutorials is an iOS app that displays several collections of Tutorial topics within a library. The user can scroll
through and select the different sections of topics. Upon selection, a user can see the details of a specific 
topic, as well as see a list of videos related to said topic. The user can queue topics and that list is maintained
within the Queued tab. From here, a user can delete any queued topics. 

Tutorials uses a custom app icon created in the Sketch project that is within in this repo!
